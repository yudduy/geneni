# Geneni: A LLM Agent for Biological Data Analysis and Drug Discovery

## Overview

**Geneni** is a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) Agent designed to revolutionize biological data analysis and aid in drug discovery research. Originating from [llm_agents](https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents/tree/main), Geneni has been enhanced with advanced tools, integrated with the Gemini API, and meticulously prompt-engineered and fine-tuned to accurately evaluate biological data.

## Features

- **Advanced Biological Data Analysis**: Geneni excels in interpreting complex biological datasets, providing insights that drive research and development in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
- **Drug Discovery Support**: Facilitates the discovery and development of new drugs by evaluating biological data with high precision.
- **Integrated Tools**: Equipped with a suite of tools tailored for biological research.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Uses the Gemini API for enhanced data processing and analysis capabilities.
- **Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning**: Carefully engineered prompts and fine-tuning ensure Geneni's responses are highly relevant and accurate for biological contexts.
